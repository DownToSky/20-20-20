# The 20-20-20 Rule
If you ever had to sit in front of the computer as much as I do, you've had to deal with Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). Some of the symptoms are blurred vision, headaches or dry eyes. The 20-20-20 rule is an easy to remember rule recommended by optometrists to help your eyes take a break every once in while: Every 20 minutes, look at an object 20 feet (6.1 meters) or more for 20 seconds.

This is a simple chrome extension that reminds you to take a break every 20 minutes. It was a good intro to chrome API and something that I personally use.

To set this up
- Download this repo
- Open google chrome
- In the URL section type **chrome://extensions**
- Turn on the developer mode
- Select Load Unpacked and select the repository folder
- You should notice a small hourglass icon appearing on your browser action bar.

You can enable and disable the alarm by clicking on the icon.
