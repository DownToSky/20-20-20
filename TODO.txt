Don't just clear all notifications. Clear the specific one.

Don't let the notification disappear before the music is done playing. Also,
let the user end the music by clicking "I'm done!"

Allow volume management, time management, song management,
 and change of "I'm done"

Be able to use extension outside the developer mode
